    <h1>Chicken Teriyaki Recipe</h1>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        Teriyaki is derived from the Japanese root words teri, to shine, and yaki, to broil or grill. <br>
        Thatâ€™s the way traditional teriyaki looks: shiny and incised with grill marks. <br>
        In Japan, teriyaki is a mix of soy sauce, sake and the rice wine mirin, which imparts a subtle sweetness. <br>
        The teriyaki found throughout Seattle, of which this is an adaptation, is a bit more showy. <br>
        Cooks sweeten with white sugar and pineapple juice. They thicken with cornstarch. <br>
        Ginger and garlic go into the mix because of the Korean ancestry of many cooks. <br>
        It is not at all traditional, but it is simple to prepare and addictive to eat. <br>
        Be sure to plan ahead as you do need to marinate the chicken before cooking. <br>
        An overnight stay in the fridge is ideal, but many readers have been happy with a quick marinade of an hour or so.<br>
